# DemoAngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

## Requirements

## Search Page Challenge

## Part 1:
Create a page where users can search for companies by country and name and display the results in a list. Use a selector for the countries and a text input for the company name. The search action will simulate an asynchronous request, load the mocked data from a json file and display the results in a list. You can use a delay of e.g. 1 second to simulate a loading state while waiting for the data. The list of available countries and the mocked search results will be provided as json files, as well as some UI guidelines. (The guidelines are just an example, not a strict requirement.)


## Part 2:
When clicking on a search result in the list, a modal should be opened with detailed information about that company. The data to be displayed is part of the search results you used in Part 1.

## Tips:
-	use your preferred boilerplate to get started (e.g. create-react-app is a good one)
-	use any library that might help you
-	for this challenge, functionality is more important than styling; focus on details only if you have the time

## 3rd point :
-	make the countries selector and the search field mandatory;
-	use tradeshift UI components library (https://ui.tradeshift.com). See: Header, Forms, Menu, Modal, Spinner.

## Attachments:
-	app-icon.svg (svg icon to be displayed in the page header)
-	countries.json (list of available countries for the selector)
-	Frontend Challenge guidelines.pdf (illustrative UI guidelines - not a strict requirement)
-	searchResults.json (mocked data to be displayed for search results and for Company Details modal - simulate an asynchronous API call to load it)


## Part 3

Replace the mocked data with a simple service written in Node.js / Typescript.


Other requirements:
●	use Node.js or Typescript
●	use OOP
●	use design patterns
